Construction Dumpster:  Construction projects slow down when waste starts cluttering the site. That’s why we provide larger dumpsters that help keep your job sites clean and running smoothly. Our construction dumpsters are built to hold heavy debris like metal, concrete, and more.

%%



JS Dumpster Rental Roll-off Dumpster Rental<h2>

We have the right type of roll-off dumpster that can be easily rolled onto your site and placed at the most accessible spot for waste disposal. Our dumpsters are made with heavy-duty steel to hold big and bulky waste, whether it’s from a community cleanup, home renovation, or construction site debris.



They come in different sizes to fit the volume of waste you have, so you’re not stuck with one that’s too big or too small. Here’s a quick guide to the sizes of our roll-off dumpsters and the kind of projects they’re best suited for:<list>



10-yard roll-off dumpster: Our 10-yard dumpsters are compact and great for smaller projects like home renovations, garage cleanouts, spring cleaning, and small yard landscaping jobs.^^

$$



JS Dumpster Rental Front-Load Dumpster Rental<h2>

Our front-load dumpsters offer a waste solution that stays on your property for as long as you need, until you’re ready for final pickup. While they remain on-site, we schedule regular emptying days and stick to them, making these dumpsters a great choice for commercial setups like businesses, apartment complexes, schools, and other places with steady waste output.

They’re built with durable steel that helps them withstand both harsh and cool weather conditions in Grundy, VA, without giving in to wear and tear. We provide them in four different sizes to match the usual volume of waste your property generates.<list>

2-yard front-load dumpster: This is the smallest option we offer and is great for small offices, shops, salons, and cafes that produce a low volume of daily trash.^^

%%

JS Dumpster Rental Rear-Load Dumpster Rental<h2>

Rear-load dumpsters are one of the collections that best-fit spaces with access limitations because of their slimmer and taller build. Just like our front-load dumpsters, they are great for constant waste generated in commercial spaces like business areas, apartment buildings, and institutions with restricted or not-so-wide spaces, where they can be easily squeezed into alleys, behind buildings, or between tight enclosures.



They’re built with strong steel and a slanted back design that makes manual loading easier, especially in places where there’s no space for large trucks to lift from the front. Rear-load dumpsters are common in older city layouts, tight alleyways, and shared commercial complexes.



We offer them in the same standard sizes as front-loads; 2, 4, 6, and 8-yard capacities, so you can choose based on how much trash your site generates:<list>



2-yard rear-load dumpster: Ideal for small shops, boutiques, and offices with low waste output. Compact and easy to place where space is limited.^^

4-yard rear-load dumpster: A solid mid-size container, often used by small restaurants, clinics, or local businesses that need something a little larger but still space-efficient.^^

6-yard rear-load dumpster: Suitable for midsize to large businesses, schools, or mixed-use buildings. Handles a good amount of weekly waste.^^

8-yard rear-load dumpster: The largest of our rear-load options. Best for large commercial properties, apartment buildings, or any site with high waste volume but limited access for front-loading trucks.

Our roll-off dumpsters come in the following sizes:

10-yard roll-off dumpster: These dumpsters are easy to load from the top, standing at just 3.5 feet high. They can hold up to 2 tons of waste.

15-yard roll-off dumpster: These ones start to look taller and come with a walk-in door that makes loading easier. With a height of 4.5 feet, they can hold up to 3 tons of waste.

20-yard roll-off dumpster: Same height as the 15-yard dumpster but a bit longer. They can carry about 3.5 tons of waste.

30-yard roll-off dumpster: These are built tougher than the 10, 15, and 20-yard options. Made with industrial-grade steel, they’re wider and taller than the 20-yard dumpster and can hold up to 4 tons of waste.

40-yard roll-off dumpster: The biggest of them all. Made with high-strength steel, they stand 8 feet tall and include a walk-in door that makes loading easy and less stressful. They can hold up to 5 tons of waste.

We’ve rented dumpsters before, but the process was always a headache. JS Dumpster Rental made it unbelievably easy. I called, picked a size, and it was delivered the next morning. Pickup was just smooth.<h2>- Glen Marcus

We hosted a large outdoor food festival and needed multiple front-load dumpsters for cleanup. JS Dumpster Rental worked with our timeline, and the dumpsters were clean and easy for staff to use. The hinged lids were a big plus! Definitely keeping them in our vendor list.<h2>- Jessica Aaron

                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px;">Frequently Asked Questions in Grundy, VA</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">When should I choose a rear-load dumpster over a front-load dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Rear-load dumpsters are built slim and tall, which makes them easier to fit into tight or narrow spaces. Since they’re loaded from the back into our garbage truck, they can also be moved and positioned by hand more easily when needed. Unlike front-load dumpsters, which require a special front-loading truck to lift and empty them, rear-loads are more flexible in areas with limited access. So if space is tight within your property, a rear-load dumpster is likely the better fit.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Instead of renting a big dumpster, can I rent two multiple dumpsters?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">It’s best to talk to us whenever you’d like to make this kind of decision, so we can help you figure out the most cost-effective or practically better option. Renting multiple dumpsters that give you the same capacity as a larger one may end up costing more, but it can be the better choice if you have waste in multiple areas or if space is too tight for a large dumpster.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Do your dumpsters have specific weight limits?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, each size of our dumpster has a specific weight capacity it can hold. If it gets filled beyond the maximum weight limit, you could face a fine from Grundy, VA’s waste management authority and you may also be charged additional fees by us.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Can I dispose of refrigerators in your dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">No, we don’t accept refrigerators in our dumpsters because they contain freon, which is harmful to the environment. However, we can help recommend a certified HVAC technician who can safely remove or recover it for you.</p>
