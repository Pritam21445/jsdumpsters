                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px;">Frequently Asked Questions in #State</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">When should I choose a rear-load dumpster over a front-load dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Rear-load dumpsters are built slim and tall, which makes them easier to fit into tight or narrow spaces. Since they’re loaded from the back into our garbage truck, they can also be moved and positioned by hand more easily when needed. Unlike front-load dumpsters, which require a special front-loading truck to lift and empty them, rear-loads are more flexible in areas with limited access. So if space is tight within your property, a rear-load dumpster is likely the better fit.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Instead of renting a big dumpster, can I rent two multiple dumpsters?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">It’s best to talk to us whenever you’d like to make this kind of decision, so we can help you figure out the most cost-effective or practically better option. Renting multiple dumpsters that give you the same capacity as a larger one may end up costing more, but it can be the better choice if you have waste in multiple areas or if space is too tight for a large dumpster.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Do your dumpsters have specific weight limits?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes, each size of our dumpster has a specific weight capacity it can hold. If it gets filled beyond the maximum weight limit, you could face a fine from #State’s waste management authority and you may also be charged additional fees by us.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Can I dispose of refrigerators in your dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">No, we don’t accept refrigerators in our dumpsters because they contain freon, which is harmful to the environment. However, we can help recommend a certified HVAC technician who can safely remove or recover it for you.</p>
